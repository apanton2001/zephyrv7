# LLM Training Techniques

This repository implements several practical techniques from "The Ultra-Scale Playbook: Training LLMs on GPU Clusters" (Hugging Face, 2025) that can significantly speed up training and reduce memory usage for large language models.

## üöÄ Techniques Implemented

1. **Gradient Accumulation**: Train with larger effective batch sizes while using limited memory
2. **Mixed Precision Training**: Speed up training using FP16/BF16 precision with less memory usage  
3. **ZeRO Optimizer**: Parameter sharding techniques inspired by DeepSpeed ZeRO
4. **Efficient Attention**: Memory-efficient attention implementation inspired by Flash Attention

All techniques work well even on consumer hardware like laptops and desktop computers with limited GPU memory.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch >= 2.0
- CUDA compatible GPU (optional but recommended)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm_training_techniques.git
cd llm_training_techniques
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìö Usage

### Command Line Interface

The easiest way to experiment with these techniques is through the provided CLI:

```bash
# Run a benchmark that compares all techniques
python main.py --technique integration --benchmark

# Try gradient accumulation with a small model
python main.py --technique gradient_accumulation --model_size tiny --batch_size 8 --accumulation_steps 4

# Run mixed precision training with BF16
python main.py --technique mixed_precision --precision bf16 --batch_size 16

# Use ZeRO optimizer (stage 2) with CPU offloading
python main.py --technique zero --zero_stage 2 --cpu_offload

# Test efficient attention with a medium model and long sequence
python main.py --technique efficient_attention --model_size medium --seq_len 2048
```

### Python API

Each technique is implemented as a standalone module and can be used independently in your own code:

#### Gradient Accumulation

```python
from techniques.gradient_accumulation import train_with_gradient_accumulation

# Train with an effective batch size of 64 (16 * 4)
stats = train_with_gradient_accumulation(
    model, 
    dataloader, 
    optimizer, 
    accumulation_steps=4,
    criterion=loss_function,
    epochs=3
)
```

#### Mixed Precision Training

```python
from techniques.mixed_precision import train_with_mixed_precision

# Train with BF16 mixed precision
stats = train_with_mixed_precision(
    model, 
    dataloader, 
    optimizer,
    criterion=loss_function,
    precision="bf16",
    epochs=3
)
```

#### ZeRO Optimizer

```python
from techniques.zero_optimizer import ZeROAdamW

# Create a memory-efficient optimizer with Stage 2 sharding
optimizer = ZeROAdamW(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=5e-5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    stage=2,
    cpu_offload=True  # Further reduce GPU memory by offloading to CPU
)
```

#### Efficient Attention

```python
from techniques.efficient_attention import EfficientAttention, convert_model_to_efficient_attention

# Create an efficient attention module
efficient_attn = EfficientAttention(
    dim=768,
    num_heads=12,
    dropout=0.1,
    causal=True,  # For causal (autoregressive) models
    memory_efficient=True
)

# Or convert all attention modules in an existing model
model = convert_model_to_efficient_attention(model)
```

### Combining All Techniques

See `integration_example.py` for a complete example that combines all techniques:

```python
from integration_example import integration_example

stats = integration_example(
    dim=768,
    num_layers=12,
    num_heads=12,
    batch_size=8,
    accumulation_steps=4,
    zero_stage=2,
    use_efficient_attention=True,
    use_mixed_precision=True,
    precision="bf16"
)
```

## üìà Expected Benefits

Depending on your model size and hardware, you can expect:

- **Gradient Accumulation**: Train with 2-16x larger effective batch sizes
- **Mixed Precision Training**: 1.5-3x speedup with 30-50% less memory usage
- **ZeRO Optimizer**: 2-4x memory reduction enabling larger models
- **Efficient Attention**: 1.3-2x speedup and 30-60% less memory for attention computations
- **All Combined**: Up to 5x speedup and 70% less memory usage
