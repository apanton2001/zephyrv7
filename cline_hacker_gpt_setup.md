# Setting Up Uncensored-HackerCoding-GPT with Cline

This guide explains how to set up the Uncensored-HackerCoding-GPT model from Hugging Face to work with Cline for educational purposes.

## Configuration File Overview

The `cline_hacker_gpt_config.json` file contains the necessary configuration for connecting Cline to the Uncensored-HackerCoding-GPT model. Here's what each section does:

### Model Configuration
- Defines basic information about the model including its name, provider, and type
- Sets a version for tracking configuration changes

### API Configuration
- Specifies the API endpoint for making inference requests
- Contains placeholders for your Hugging Face API key
- Defines required headers for API requests

### Inference Parameters
- Controls the behavior of the model during text generation
- Includes settings like temperature, top_p, and max_length that affect output quality and variety

### Custom Settings
- Configures model-specific behaviors for code generation
- Includes a system prompt that guides the model toward producing code-focused outputs
- Sets caching options to improve performance

## Setup Instructions

1. **Get a Hugging Face API Key**:
   - Create or log in to your [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join)
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Access Tokens
   - Create a new token with read access
   - Copy your API token

2. **Update the Configuration File**:
   - Open `cline_hacker_gpt_config.json`
   - Replace both instances of `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` with your actual API key
   - Save the file

3. **Install and Configure Cline**:
   - Make sure you have Cline installed on your system
   - Navigate to Cline's model configuration directory (usually in your user directory)
   - Copy the modified configuration file to this location

4. **Set as Default (Optional)**:
   - In your Cline settings, set the Uncensored-HackerCoding-GPT as your default model
   - This step depends on your specific Cline setup

## Usage Notes

- This configuration is provided for educational purposes only
- The model is designed to provide unrestricted code solutions and examples
- If the Hugging Face space changes, you may need to update the API endpoint
- Performance may vary based on Hugging Face's API availability and rate limits

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors**: Verify your API key is correctly inserted in the configuration file
- **Connection Issues**: Check your internet connection and Hugging Face API status
- **Output Format Problems**: Adjust the inference parameters to get better results
- **Rate Limiting**: Hugging Face may impose usage limits on API calls
