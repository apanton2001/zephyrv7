# Zephyr Warehouse Management System - Development Plan

## 1. Finalization and Integration
- Review all created pages and components for consistency and completeness.
- Refine UI/UX to ensure sleek, modern design inspired by Vercel and Supabase.
- Implement dynamic data flow and state management across pages.
- Create shared utilities and common components for reuse.
- Ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.

## 2. Backend Setup
- Design and implement RESTful API for data persistence.
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- Integrate with external services such as shipping providers and accounting software.
- Set up database schema for inventory, orders, clients, tasks, and reports.
- Implement real-time data updates using WebSockets or similar technology.

## 3. MCP Server Implementation
- Scaffold MCP server to maintain persistent project context.
- Expose tools for:
  - Reading and updating project files.
  - Managing project metadata.
  - Running project-specific commands or scripts.
- Configure MCP server for automatic startup and integration with development environment.

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Develop automated test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- Conduct manual testing and usability testing.
- Perform performance and security audits.
- Collect beta user feedback and iterate on improvements.

## 5. Deployment
- Prepare deployment scripts and environment configurations.
- Deploy application to production environment (e.g., cloud hosting).
- Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- Plan for ongoing maintenance and feature updates.

## Timeline and Milestones
| Phase                     | Estimated Duration | Milestones                          |

| Finalization & Integration | 2 weeks            | Complete UI/UX refinement         |
| Backend Setup             | 3 weeks            | API and database ready             |
| MCP Server Implementation | 1 week             | MCP server running and integrated  |
| Testing & QA              | 2 weeks            | Test coverage and beta feedback    |
| Deployment                | 1 week             | Production deployment and monitoring|

## Notes
- Prioritize core functionality and user experience.
- Maintain modular and scalable code architecture.
- Ensure thorough documentation for future development.
